# AarogyaBytes – Health Assistant Web Application

AarogyaBytes is a web-based health assistant built to provide preliminary medical guidance through structured conversations.  
The system helps users describe symptoms, answers follow-up questions, evaluates severity, and suggests an appropriate urgency level.

This project was developed as a hands-on learning exercise in building rule-based decision systems, interactive user interfaces, and client-side analytics.

## Overview

The application guides users through a multi-step conversation flow:
- Initial symptom input
- Context-aware follow-up questions
- Severity assessment on a scale of 1–10
- Final assessment with urgency classification

Based on user inputs, the system determines whether the situation is low risk, moderate, urgent, or requires immediate medical attention.
